                    <p>
                        Welcome to the home page for the curiously named 'Snack Attack' gaming clan/group/whatever.
                        From this hub, members and newcomers alike can check out our Twitch Channels, 
                        meet the crew, discover the games we play and information on how to access our Discord channel.
                        </br></br>
                        We're friendly (well...mostly), approachable (debatable) and are always looking for new members to
                        join us in our antics! Whatever your favourite genre or game, we're usually up for a session. Hit us up
                        on Discord to find out more! (LINK ABOVE)

                    <h3>So Who Are We?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Formed during a tense session of Rainbow Six: Siege, the name and idea to form a group was prompted by what 
                        can only be described as either pure brilliance or sheer madness.
                        <br><br>
                        The name, coined by none other than David (Mr. Flibble), has been our humble title ever since that fateful night
                        and our UPlay tags now all bare a relationship to the peculiar name (CorporalCustard, LadyLettuce, SergeantSauce, you get the idea).
                        We are a group of people coming from all over the world that share the same common interest of gaming.
